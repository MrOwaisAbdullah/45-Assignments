//making intentional error by putting wrong index number
let friend1:string[] = ["Zain", "Talha", "Asim", "Abdullah"];

//console.log(`Hello ${friend[5]}, hope you're doing well!`);  this is giving undefined result

// Corrected the index number
console.log(`Hello ${friend1[3]}, hope you're doing well!`);
